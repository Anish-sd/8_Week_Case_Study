-- A. Customer Journey

--Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, 
--write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

--Try to keep it as short as possible - 
--you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

  /* The customer once he joins the service will have a trial period of about one week.
     Then he will have to purchase a basic or a pro plan to continue the service. 
	 Basic monthly plan can be subscribed only monthly whereas the pro plan has the monthly
